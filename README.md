When “View all games” button is clicked:
To view user profiles which is not own profile, click the author’s name in the first column (titanfall002, mcqueenkachow, etc.)
To view one’s own profile, click on the author’s name in the second column (chickenjoy77, grant_palmos, etc.), or click the user icon on the top right and choose view profile. 
To view profiles in admin's point of view, click the author’s name in the third column (kungpaoch1cken, pamela1, etc.)

The program is currently design with the user currently being Geosef Uy thus clicking the author geosefuy will lead you to view your profile. When clicked on byronnill on the other hand, it would lead you to be as if you are the admin named “Byron Nill” and you would be able to view your profile as an admin. Clicking all other authors would lead you to viewing a user’s profile. Thus, if you are currently as “Geosef Uy” you would normally be able to view the user’s profile, but if you are currently as “Byron Nill” and clicked an author you would be shown how an admin views other user’s profiles.
